Audio File Comparison Script
----------------------------

This script is designed to compare two audio files to identify differences in their technical data and metadata.

Requirements:
- You need to have ffprobe installed (usually comes with FFmpeg).
- Mutagen library should be installed in Python (use 'pip install mutagen').

How to Use:
1. Place the script in the same directory as the audio files or provide the full path to the files.
2. Run the script from the command line with two audio files as arguments.

Example Command:
python compare_audio_files.py audiofile1.mp3 audiofile2.mp3

The script will output differences in the following areas:
- Streams: Codec, bit rate, sample rate, etc.
- Format: Overall file format details.
- Packets: Detailed frame-by-frame analysis.
- Metadata: ID3 tags, album information, etc.

Use this script to diagnose issues, identify corruption, or confirm file integrity between two audio files.
